# Hangman-Game

This is a very basic word guessing game both in command prompt mode and GUI using Tkinter module.

### Console version


To run the console version you need to download only :  'Custom Words mid range.csv' & 'Hangman Game.py'
                                            
                                                            
### GUI version:

Clone/Download the 'Hangman Tkinter GUI' folder.

You might need to install 'Tkinter' module. You can use 'pip install tkinter' in the command prompt to install the module.

......Bug : For Replay in the GUI Version you might face problem. You might have to re-launch the app for that.


.........Need improvements. Any kind of suggestion is welcome.........
